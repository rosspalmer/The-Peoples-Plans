# Bash Shell and Scripting

Having a working knowledge of the command line interface (CLI)
interface is essential to having complete control of your
computer whether that be your local PC, a remote server,
or a whole cluster of resources. The bash shell provides access
to a machine's command line interface and scripting allows us to
automate and program these commands.

## What is the Bash Shell (CLI)?

All computers require some form of interface to interact with it
in real time. A modern PC uses a graphical user interface (GUI) 
to interact with the computers operating system (OS). GUIs are 
optimized to be human-friendly and are not the best option for all 
types of interactions with computing resources.

The command line interface (CLI) uses text only commands to interact with
a computer directly. This could be the whole of the OS, like an old DOS 
machine; a GUI window within a modern OS, like Terminal in Macs; or a 
program which allows access to a remote machine, like an SSH client. 
While using text commands may seem old-fashioned, the half-century old
practice is utilized now more than ever.

## Why CLI?

- **Precision:** Using text only commands allows for exact precision in
both sending instructions to a computer or to Anyone that has followed a "click heavy" tutorial can 
sympathize with this advantage. T
