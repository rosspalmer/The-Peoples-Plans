# Bash Shell and Scripting

Having a working knowledge of the command line interface (CLI)
interface is essential to having complete control of your
computer whether that be your local PC, a remote server,
or a whole cluster of resources. The bash shell provides access
to a machine's command line interface and scripting allows us to
automate and program these commands.

## What is the Bash Shell (CLI)?

All computers require some form of interface to interact with it
in real time. A modern PC uses a graphical user interface (GUI) 
to interact with the computers operating system (OS). GUIs are 
optimized to be human-friendly and are not the best option for all 
types of interactions with computing resources.

The command line interface (CLI) uses text only commands to interact with
a computer directly. This could be the whole of the OS, like an old DOS 
machine; a GUI window within a modern OS, like Terminal in Macs; or a 
program which allows access to a remote machine, like an SSH client. 
While using text commands may seem old-fashioned, the half-century old
practice is utilized now more than ever.

## Why CLI?

Most important reason is you **will** need to some day but below are some
general reasons why it's a useful tool:

- **Precision:** Using text only commands allows for exact precision in
both sending instructions to a computer and sharing commands with others.
- **Functionality:** Adding functions and different configurations is easy
in a text based commands so much more is possible using the CLI than any GUI.
- **Computer Friendly:** Using the CLI is in itself a programming language
where each time you enter a command you are entering a line of code. These 
means the power of the CLI can be automated in scripts.
- **No "Click on" Tutorials:** Part of learning is reading online docs and
tutorials and using the CLI removes the need for confusing "click on" steps.
Instead, sets of commands are shared which are exact and can be modified
if necessary.

## Shell Implementations

A "shell" is any program which exposes the functionality of a computers OS
to the user of the program. We use the GUI shell of our OS every day but 
your computer also offers a CLI shell, which also differs depending on
your OS/configuration. There are many types of shells but they all have
the same purpose of granting control of a computer.

### Unix vs Microsoft

The biggest difference in CLI shell implementation will be Unix vs Microsoft
based OSs. Mac and Linux machines are Unix based and have very similar CLI
implementations which have massive libraries and are used universally by
devops, engineers, and developers. Microsoft offers a command line (cmd) and
now PowerShell which can be useful for Microsoft specific things but is not
useful as a developer.

Options are listed below for Microsoft users but going forward all discussion
will be based on the Unix CLI. These implementations are run via a specific
program which differ slightly but not enough to matter for this doc. Historically
`bash` has been the most popular shell for Unix systems but now Z-Shell `zsh` is
gaining popularity amongst others. Your OS may be using an updated type of shell
without you evening knowing, but it doesn't matter here. We will be using well 
established `bash` commands which are included in all modern implementations.

The shell program can be accessed using the OS's Terminal/Console program, 
an IDE,  a remote SSH connection, a shell script, or other methods. While there 
may be different reasons to use each, the same shell program is utilized via
the same text commands.

There is no single book to read on the topic but having a book covering a
range of `bash` commands, general linux/unix mechanics and shell scripting.
