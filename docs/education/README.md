# Education Docs

This is a collection of short guides introducing topics
important to the work of a software developer. The docs are 
quick, high-level reviews on how to get started on large areas
and should not be step-by-step instructions.

## The Classics

While software development can involve many rapidly evolving
technologies and paradigms, there are a few that have existed
for decades relatively unchanged. These are essential to know
now and for the foreseeable future.

### [Bash Shell (CLI) and Scripting](./pages/1-bash-shell-and-scripting.md)

Having a working knowledge of the command line interface (CLI)
interface is essential to having complete control of your
computer whether that be your local PC, a remote server,
or a whole cluster of resources. The bash shell provides access
to a machine's command line interface and scripting allows us to
automate and program these commands.

### [Code Theory](./pages/2-code-theory.md)

Today many developers learn to code through direct participation,
whether through tutorials, home-brewed projects, or on the job
experience. While this is a great way to get started, it is
important to supplement the practical knowledge with basic code
theory to maximize your abilities and provide a path for growth.
Code theory may be as small as learning to write "clean code" to
as large as proper architecture design, but having a higher level
understanding of the language agnostic knowledge built over decades
of practice is essential to working well with other developers.
